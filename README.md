### Game rules :

1. In each round, five regular cards and one answer card are randomly dealt.
2. Within a 3-minute time limit, use the operators +, -, *, and / to combine the five regular cards to match the answer card.
3. If you believe there is no solution for the round, press 'NA' (No Answer).
4. Each card must be used exactly once.
5. Calculations are performed from left to right; there is no priority order for multiplication and division over addition and subtraction.

### Winner Determination:

1. If both sides calculate correctly, the faster one wins.
2. If both sides answer 'NA' the faster one wins.
3. If one side calculates incorrectly and the other answers 'NA', the 'NA' side wins.
4. If one side is correct and the other answers 'NA', the correct side wins.
5. If both sides calculate incorrectly, it's a tie.
